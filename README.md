**WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS RESEARCH?** 

Jiaoyang Ma, a PhD student at UTS.  My supervisor is Wenjing Jia （wenjing.jia@uts.edu.au） 
 
**WHAT IS THE RESEARCH ABOUT?** 

This research is to develop an Automatic Speech Error Correction system that can accurately detect and 
correct errors in speech using bi-directional technologies of speech recognition and speech synthesis. 
 
This online survey requires the participants to give scores on the quality of the machine-synthesized 
speech audios using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluation metric so as to evaluate the performance 
of the system. 
 
You have been invited to participate because the participant's auditory perception rates the Mean 
Opinion Score. Thus, the naturalness and similarity of the speech synthesis are judged.   
 
The scoring is anonymous and your personal information will not be recorded and collected. 
 
**WHAT DOES MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?** 

Participation in this study is voluntary. It is completely up to you whether you decide to participate. 
If you decide to participate, I will invite you to click this link (will not identify your personal information), 
listen to the 10 short audio files in the link and compare the similarity between the top and bottom audio 
and give a rating by completing an online questionnaire. For most participants, it takes 10~15 minutes to 
compete all the ratings. 
 
You can change your mind at any time and stop completing the survey/s without consequences. 
 
**ARE THERE ANY RISKS/INCONVENIENCE?** 

 We don’t expect this questionnaire to cause any harm or discomfort. However, if you experience 
discomfort or distress answering the questions please contact your family doctor or physician. 
 
**WHAT IF I HAVE ANY QUERIES OR CONCERNS?** 

If you have any queries or concerns about the research that you think I, Jiaoyang Ma or my supervisor can 
help you with, please feel free to contact me Jiaoyang Ma on Jiaoyang.ma@student.uts.edu.au.
