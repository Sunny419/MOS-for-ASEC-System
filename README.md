# MOS-for-ASEC-System

Dear Participants,

We kindly request your participation in a survey related to the "End-to-End Automatic Speech Error Correction Voice Cloning and Correction" project. Your input is crucial in helping us improve and refine our processes.

To provide valuable feedback, kindly follow the instructions outlined below:
(PS. Processed Voice Data will be available soon. For resting, we have provided two sample files below.) 
1. Access the original audio files by clicking on the following link: Source.wav
2. Listen to the ASEC (Automatic Speech Error Correction) audio by clicking on the following link: result.wav.
3. Then, proceed to complete the survey by clicking on the following link: MOS Survey Link - https://www.surveymonkey.com/r/KZJV2K7.
Before you proceed with the survey, we kindly ask you to read the "ONLINE SURVEY INFORMATION SHEET" provided below.

Thank you in advance for your valuable contribution to our research. Your input will significantly aid us in enhancing our techniques and advancing the field of Automatic Speech Error Correction.

Should you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out to us. Your support is greatly appreciated.

WHO IS CONDUCTING THIS RESEARCH?
Jiaoyang Ma, a PhD student at UTS.  My supervisor is Wenjing Jia （wenjing.jia@uts.edu.au）

WHAT IS THE RESEARCH ABOUT?
This research is to develop an Automatic Speech Error Correction system that can accurately detect and correct errors in speech using bi-directional technologies of speech recognition and speech synthesis.

This online survey requires the participants to give scores on the quality of the machine-synthesized speech audios using the Mean Opinion Score (MOS) evaluation metric so as to evaluate the performance of the system.

You have been invited to participate because the participant's auditory perception rates the Mean Opinion Score. Thus, the naturalness and similarity of the speech synthesis are judged.  

The scoring is anonymous, and your personal information will not be recorded and collected.

WHAT DOES MY PARTICIPATION INVOLVE?
Participation in this study is voluntary. It is completely up to you whether you decide to participate.
If you decide to participate, I will invite you to click this link (will not identify your personal information), listen to the ten short audio files in the link and compare the similarity between the top and bottom audio and give a rating by completing an online questionnaire. For most participants, it takes 10~15 minutes to complete all the ratings.

You can change your mind at any time and stop completing the survey/s without consequences.

ARE THERE ANY RISKS/INCONVENIENCE?
 We don’t expect this questionnaire to cause any harm or discomfort. However, if you experience discomfort or distress answering the questions please contact your family doctor or physician.


WHAT WILL HAPPEN TO INFORMATION ABOUT ME?
Access to the online questionnaire is via: https://github.com/Sunny419/MOS-for-ASEC-System/tree/main. Submission of the online questionnaire is an indication of your consent. 

No identifying information will be collected from you during the survey process, or in any publication and/or presentation

In accordance with relevant Australian and/or NSW Privacy laws, you have the right to request access to the information about you that is collected and stored by the research team. You also have the right to request that any information with which you disagree be corrected. Please inform the research team member named at the end of this document if you would like to access your information. This will only be possible if you provide personal information which may individually identify you, or be reasonably identifiable (e.g. if any open-text responses contextually identify or re-identify you). 
It is anticipated that the results of this research project will be published and/or presented in a variety of forums. The results of this research may also be shared through open access (public) scientific databases, including internet databases. This will enable other researchers to use the data to investigate other important research questions. Results shared in this way will always be de-identified by removing all personal information (e.g. your name, address, date of birth etc.) and/or any contextual information that could identify you.


WHAT IF I HAVE ANY QUERIES OR CONCERNS?
If you have any queries or concerns about the research that you think I, Jiaoyang Ma or my supervisor can help you with, please feel free to contact me Jiaoyang Ma on Jiaoyang.ma@student.uts.edu.au.  

If you would like to talk to someone who is not connected with the research, or if you have any concerns or complaints about any aspect of the conduct of this research that you wish to raise independently of the research team, please contact the Ethics Secretariat on 02 9514 2478 email or Research.ethics@uts.edu.au and quote the UTS HREC reference number.  Any matter raised will be treated confidentially, investigated and you will be informed of the outcome.
